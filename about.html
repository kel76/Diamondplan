			SFI is an international network marketing company. Its full name is Strong Future International (originally Six Figure Income), and is owned by Carson Services Inc, based in  Nebraska, USA.
			<div></div>
SFI launched in 1998, and has gone through many changes and evolutions since then. It is now a solid and well established company in its 22nd successful year that gains thousands of new affiliates every day. Yesterday one new affiliate joined SFI every 26 seconds. The growth is phenomenal, and there are good reasons for it.

The heart of any company is its products, and SFI has a product range that most network marketing companies would envy. Products are sold through the online shopping site, TripleClicks, which is rather like Amazon in that it has products available from TripleClicks itself and also from other private and business sellers. This means the range of products is almost limitless, and potential customers are bound to find something they like.  Find out more about  TripleClicks  HERE. 
The support and encouragement given to new affiliates at SFI is unequaled by any other network marketing company.  There are  extensive training materials, and affiliates are  rewarded for working  through them.  In addition to the usual sponsor (the person who referred them to SFI) and upline team, each affiliate is allocated a cosponsor, who is an additional source of  support and advice, and can communicate with yet more experienced affiliates through the a2a (affiliate 2 affiliate) network.  Thereâ€™s also a contest for all new affiliates  called E365 (Entrepreneur 365) that runs for the first year after registration and rewards contestants with prizes, as well as providing an extra incentive to develop their business.
